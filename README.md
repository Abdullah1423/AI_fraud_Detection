<!-- Project Overview -->
## Project Overview


<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>
Online payment is currently the most prevalent transaction method in the 
world. However, as the number of online payments grows, so does the 
number of fraudulent transactions. The goal of this project is to identify 
both fraudulent and non-fraudulent payments.

<!-- USAGE -->
## Usage

<h4>Anomaly Detection in Transactions </h4> 
Online transactions are another prime target for fraudsters. Here's how ML can be applied
<h4>Account Takeover (ATO) Prevention:</h4> 
Imagine you run an online store. Fraudsters often attempt to gain unauthorized access to legitimate user accounts (ATO) to make fraudulent purchases.

<!-- Dataset -->
## Dataset

We searched for a dataset to support our idea and found an excellent dataset 
on the Kaggle website

Check it out from here [Kiggle]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rupakroy/online-payments-fraud￾detection-dataset?resource=download)

<!-- Model Details -->
## Model Details
[XGBoost:](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) This gradient boosting model excels at handling large datasets and complex fraud patterns. It's highly accurate but can be a "black box" and requires tuning.
</br>
[Decision Trees:](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html) Easy to understand and interpret, decision trees are relatively fast to train. They work well with various data types but might struggle with complex relationships and overfitting.
</br>
[Feedforward Neural Networks:](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neural_networks_supervised.html) These deep learning models can capture intricate patterns in data, potentially leading to superior accuracy. However, they're computationally expensive, challenging to interpret, and prone to overfitting if not carefully regularized.
